# MyCrew — Build Context for Claude Code

## What this app is

A private, invite-only roster management tool for small business owners who hire
part-timers directly (not an open marketplace). The first real use case is a craft
workshop business that hires facilitators and logistics/setup support for events.

Two user types:
- **Business Owner** — manages a closed roster of part-timers they've personally
  added, creates shifts, assigns people to slots, tracks hours and pay.
- **Part-Timer** — views their assigned shifts and pay, edits their profile/avatar.
  Only sees businesses they've been explicitly invited to.

This is **not** an open marketplace. Part-timers cannot browse or apply to jobs.

## Tech stack (as built)

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Postgres.app (local)
- **ORM:** Prisma v7 with `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter (no native engine)
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js v5 beta (Auth.js) — Credentials provider, JWT sessions
- **Prisma config:** URL lives in `prisma.config.ts`, not in `schema.prisma`
- **Migrations:** Manual SQL via `prisma migrate deploy` (non-interactive env)
- **GitHub:** `https://github.com/evontay/RosterApp` (private)

### Key Prisma v7 notes
- No bundled engine — requires `@prisma/adapter-pg` + `pg`
- Client instantiated with adapter: `new PrismaClient({ adapter })`
- After any schema change: kill dev server → `npx prisma generate` → `rm -rf .next` → restart

## Current state

### Owner-side features
- Auth (email + password login)
- **Roster**: invite, archive/restore members; avatar display; skills; availability; "Worked with" section on each profile
- **Shifts + Calendar**: combined two-column page (`/dashboard/shifts`) — list on left, 3-month scrollable calendar on right
  - Create/edit shifts from either panel
  - Sort by date (asc/desc)
  - Shift status: Open → Confirmed → Logged → Paid (labels consistent across all surfaces)
  - Auto-advance to "filled" when all slots staffed; revert to "open" on unassign
  - Archive paid shifts; cancelled shifts auto-archive; unarchive anytime
  - Cancelled shifts excluded from calendar view
- **Slot-based staffing**: each role on a shift has N slots; boss fills each slot by selecting an employee (manual) OR confirming an interested employee
- **Interest management**: shift detail shows pending interests with employee name (clickable → profile modal), comment, Confirm/Reject actions
- **Employee profile modal**: avatar, skills, completed job count, link to full roster profile
- **Hours + pay**: log hours per assignment, pay auto-calculated from role's pay type/rate
- **Mark as paid** per assignment or all at once; **Unmark paid** per assignment if mistake
- **Shift status corrections**: "Unmark as logged" reverts a completed shift back to filled/open based on current slot count; "Mark as logged" is blocked before the shift date (UI grayed out + API guard)
- **Dashboard**: active employees, shifts this month, status counts (open/confirmed/logged); unread activity banner; "Needs attention" section (understaffed shifts, pending interests, unpaid employees); next 7 days upcoming shifts with staffing ratio
- **Activity feed** (`/dashboard/activity`): append-only event log grouped by date; badge count in nav; marks all read on visit
- **Settings → Role types**: create, rename, archive/restore; default pay type and rate per role
- **Settings → Performance tags**: create, rename, archive/restore owner-defined job-performance tags scoped per business
- **Performance records**: on completed shift detail, each assignment row shows Add/Edit record — attendance (attended/late/no-show), optional quality flag (good/issues), optional tags, optional private notes. Retroactively editable.
- **Trust signals on roster profile**: Performance section shows Reliability % and Quality %, both computed with 180-day exponential decay (recent shifts weighted more). Raw record count shown as context. Color-coded green ≥80 / yellow 60–79 / red <60. Quality shows "—" until at least one quality flag is set.
- **Performance log on roster profile**: below the score bars, a chronological log (newest first) of every ObjectiveRecord — shift name, date, attendance/quality badges, tags, and private notes if written. Visible to owner only, never to employee.
- **Kudos**: on a completed shift detail, each assigned employee has a "Send kudos" link below the performance record form. Owner writes a short message; upserted one per shift per employee. Employees see kudos in their home feed.

### Employee-side features
- Auth (email + password)
- **Home** (`/home`): avatar, profile info, skills, shift history stats (Shifts / Hours / Earned), milestone badges, kudos feed, upcoming shifts
- **Open Shifts** (`/open-shifts`): all upcoming open shifts across active businesses; express interest with optional comment; withdraw if still pending
- **My Shifts** (`/my-shifts`): full assignment history, sort by date, clickable cards
- **Shift detail** (`/shifts/[id]`): shift info, assigned role, pay rate, payment status
- **Activity feed** (`/activity`): notifications for interest confirmed/rejected, assigned, shift cancelled, paid, hours logged, kudos received; badge count in nav; marks all read on visit
- **Settings** (`/my-settings`): edit name, phone, avatar (emoji + background colour); skills (pill selector, applies across all active business memberships); availability preference per day (Morning/Afternoon/Flexible)

## Key business logic

- **Slot-based assignment**: each `ShiftRole` has a `count` (slots). Boss fills slots one by one via manual assign OR by confirming a `ShiftInterest`. Each `ShiftAssignment` links to a `shiftRoleId`. Manual dropdown filtered to employees with matching skill.
- **One employee per shift**: an employee cannot fill two slots on the same shift. The assign API checks for any non-cancelled assignment (not just role-linked ones) to prevent duplicates after a shift edit.
- **Edit shift — role diffing**: the PUT `/api/shifts/[id]` route diffs new roles against existing ones by `skillId`. Matching roles are updated in-place (preserving assignment links). New skillIds create fresh roles. Removed skillIds null out their assignments' `shiftRoleId` before deletion. This ensures staffing is retained after an edit unless a role type is explicitly removed.
- **Orphaned assignments**: if a `ShiftAssignment` has `shiftRoleId: null` (left by a role deletion during edit) and the owner tries to re-assign the same employee, the API re-uses the orphaned record (updates it) rather than creating a duplicate.
- **Auto-advance status**: when all slots across all roles are filled → shift auto-advances to `filled`. Unassigning reverts `filled` → `open`. Confirming an interest also triggers this check.
- **Interest flow**: employees express interest in open shifts (with optional comment) via `/open-shifts`. Owner confirms (picks role) or rejects on the shift detail page. Confirming creates a `ShiftAssignment`. Employee can withdraw if still `pending`.
- **Interest uniqueness**: `@@unique([shiftId, partTimerId, shiftRoleId])` — one general interest per employee per shift (`shiftRoleId = null`).
- **Archive rules**: only fully-paid or cancelled shifts can be archived. Cancelled shifts auto-archive on cancellation.
- **Draft removed**: shifts are created as `open` by default. The `draft` enum value exists in the DB but is unused.
- **Status labels** (UI only, DB values unchanged): `open` → Open, `filled` → Confirmed, `completed` → Logged. Consistent across shift list badges, stepper, calendar legend, and dashboard.
- **Mark as logged gate**: cannot mark a shift as logged before its `shiftDate`. Enforced at the API level and grayed out in the UI.
- **Status corrections**: "Unmark as logged" recalculates status from slot fill state (→ `filled` if full, → `open` if not). "Unmark paid" per assignment reverts `paymentStatus` to `unpaid`. Both are owner-only.
- **Activity feed**: append-only `Activity` table, scoped by `recipientId` (userId). Written by API routes on key events. Nav badge shows unread count (server-rendered per request). Visiting the activity page marks all as read. Employee-side events: `ASSIGNED`, `INTEREST_CONFIRMED`, `INTEREST_REJECTED`, `SHIFT_CANCELLED`, `PAID`, `HOURS_LOGGED` (shows hours + pay amount), `KUDOS_RECEIVED` (shows message).
- **Employee skills**: employees set their own skills from Settings; applied across all active business memberships. Owner can also edit skills from the roster profile.
- **Nav**: "MyCrew" logo is the homepage link for both roles (owner → `/dashboard`, employee → `/home`). No separate Home/Dashboard nav item. Owner Settings is a hover dropdown with Role types and Performance tags.
- **Trust signals** (`lib/trust.ts`): `computeTrustSignals(records)` returns `{ reliability, quality, recordCount }`. Both scores use 180-day half-life exponential decay. Reliability counts all records; Quality counts only flagged ones. Returns `null` when no data exists for that signal. Scores are owner-only — never shown to employees.
- **Performance records**: declines and withdrawals never create ObjectiveRecords — only actual shift attendance.
- **Milestones** (`lib/milestones.ts`): `MILESTONES` array (7 badges) checked against `{ completedShifts, uniqueCoworkers }`. `computeMilestones(stats)` returns `{ unlocked, next }`. Computed on the fly from existing data — no separate table.
- **Kudos**: one per employee per shift (upsert). Written by owner on the shift detail page after completion. Employee sees them in a feed on their home page. Never negative — purely positive recognition.
- **Employee home stats**: computed from `ShiftAssignment` where status=completed — total shift count, total hours logged, total pay earned. Shown inline in the profile card once there's at least one completed shift.
- **Avatar**: employees pick an emoji (or use initials) + a pastel background colour. Fallback colour is deterministically hashed from the partTimer's `id`.

## Why this document exists

Phases 1–4 are complete. Phase 5 (team-fit / pairing notes) is next. Keep the schema extensible for multi-business support and richer analytics.

---

## Phase roadmap

### Phase 1 — complete ✅
Owner manages roster, creates shifts with per-role slots and pay, assigns part-timers to slots, logs hours, marks paid. Part-timer views their shifts. Combined shifts+calendar page. Avatar system. Archive patterns throughout.

### Phase 2 — complete ✅
Employees see all open shifts and express interest (with optional comment). Owner confirms or rejects from the shift detail page. Confirming creates a `ShiftAssignment` and auto-advances shift status. Employees can withdraw pending interest. Owner retains manual assign capability. Withdrawal after confirmation is out of scope.

### Post-Phase 2 additions — complete ✅
- Activity feed (owner + employee sides, badge counts, mark-as-read)
- Employee self-service skills editor in Settings
- Shift status corrections: unmark logged, unmark paid, date gate on Mark logged
- Nav: MyCrew logo as homepage link, removed redundant Home/Dashboard items

### Phase 3 — complete ✅
ObjectiveRecord per shift per employee (attendance + quality flag + tags + private notes). PerformanceTag vocabulary scoped per business, managed in Settings. Trust signals (Reliability %, Quality %) computed with recency weighting, displayed on roster profile (owner-only). Entry point is the completed shift detail page. Private notes shown in the performance log on the roster profile.

### Phase 4 — complete ✅
Gamification for employee motivation (no visible ratings). Three features built:
- **Milestone badges**: 7 milestones (first shift, 5/10/25/50 shifts, 3/10 unique teammates), computed from existing data, displayed as yellow pill badges on employee home. Next upcoming milestone shown as a prompt.
- **Shift history stats**: total completed shifts, total hours, total earned — inline in the profile card on employee home.
- **Kudos feed**: owner writes a short positive message per employee per shift (upsert) on the completed shift detail. Employee sees a feed on their home page. Purely positive — no negative mechanism.

### Phase 5
Team-fit / pairing notes layer. Owner-customizable skill tags.

### Phase 5
Team-fit / pairing notes layer. Owner-customizable skill tags.

## Explicitly OUT of scope (do not build)

- Open marketplace / discovery — closed-roster only, permanently
- In-app payment processing — tracking only, reconciled externally
- Clock-in/clock-out — manual hours entry is sufficient
- Native mobile app — responsive web covers both surfaces

---

## Key design principles

1. **Closed roster, not a marketplace.** Enforce via `RosterMembership.status = 'active'` at the API level.
2. **Schema anticipates Phase 2-5 without building them.** Enums over booleans, separate tables, business-scoped records.
3. **No payment processing.** Tracks what's owed and marks paid manually.
4. **Multi-tenant from day one.** Every relevant table scoped by `businessId`.
5. **Declines are always free.** A decline must never reduce any score or visible standing — structural commitment, not just a rule.
